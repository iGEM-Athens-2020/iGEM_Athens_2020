# Simulations for the gliding motility mechanism that Flavobacteria have #
This code was developed in Java using the Box2D plugin for Processing Environment <br>

Each folder contains one simulation so in total there are 4 simulations : <br>
* flavos_2_ecm : Simulation containing 2 flexible cells colliding based on the Electric Coupling Model<br>
* flavos_2_vcm : Simulation containing 2 flexible cells colliding based on the Viscous Coupling Model<br>
* flavos_many_rigid_body_vcm : Simulation containing large population of cells that are considered rigid bodies, colliding based on the Viscous Coupling Model<br>
* flavos_many_flexible: Simulation containing large population of cells that are considered flexible, colliding based on the Viscous Coupling Mmodel (straightening force included).
